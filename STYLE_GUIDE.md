# Blog Writing Style Guide — InfoSec Matters (blog.infosecmatters.net)

## Author: Andy Ratcliffe

## Tone of Voice
- **Technical but accessible** — assumes a security/infrastructure professional audience but doesn't over-complicate
- **Conversational and personal** — uses first person ("I", "my"), shares honest observations ("Please note, I don't claim to be the best coder", "I often find it useful")
- **Practical and hands-on** — demonstration-driven, not theoretical; the focus is always on showing how something works in practice
- **Mentor-like** — educational intent without being patronising; guiding the reader through a process
- **Humble and honest** — acknowledges limitations, credits tools and colleagues, flags real-world gotchas

## Structure Pattern
1. **Brief introduction** — direct, no waffle; immediately states what the post is about and why it matters (1-2 short paragraphs)
2. **Step-by-step walkthrough** — the core of every post; sequential, action-oriented sections
3. **Screenshots throughout** — heavily used to show tool output, dashboards, and results rather than lengthy written explanations
4. **Code blocks** — JSON, shell commands, PowerShell, Terraform, and config snippets inline with the walkthrough
5. **Real-world observations** — notes on gotchas, issues encountered, and practical tips woven into the steps
6. **Short wrap-up** — brief concluding thoughts, often summarising what was demonstrated and why it matters

## Language Patterns
- Direct transitions: "First, let's have a look", "When the update is committed", "All of this happens based on"
- Honest qualifiers: "Obviously this is something that could be fixed with a little work"
- Experience-based tips: "I often find it useful to...", "I added Andy on the end to avoid naming conflicts"
- Short sentences mixed with longer technical explanations
- Minimal use of bullet points in body text; prefers flowing paragraphs with embedded code/screenshots
- Section headings are descriptive and functional, not clever or clickbait

## Formatting Conventions
- Blog platform: Blogger
- Title format: Descriptive, technical (e.g., "Azure Policy - Subnets should have a Network Security Group")
- Code: inline code blocks and fenced code blocks for commands/configs
- Images: screenshots with brief captions or surrounding context
- Links: to tools, documentation, and related posts where relevant

## What to Avoid
- Overly formal or academic language
- Long theoretical introductions before getting to the practical content
- Buzzword-heavy marketing speak
- Excessive bullet-point lists as the main content
- Clickbait titles or sensationalised language
